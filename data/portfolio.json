After completing my student status at Lambda I started working for the bootcamp as a Team Lead walking students through the full curriculum. This is when I discovered my love for teaching and developer education. In my carrer I have worked for multiple companies and startups as a developer touching everything from traditional web development, Backend Enterprise API development, crossplatform mobile development, and AI/ML implementation and development. My expertise lies in Bitcoin and Lightning development, App Development, and Developer Education. I have built a multitude of free open source apps within the Bitcoin/Lightning/Nostr ecosystem. Along with all of this I have also been running the Plebdevs community for the past 2 years. I have built multiple courses, do live workshops, 1:1 tutoring, and more. I am passionate about building and teaching and I am always looking for new opportunities to do so.",
